  This block adds Review Answers to the menu after a certain point in the interview, when all of the information is collected.  It does this because add_review_to_menu is initially set to false (in block id: set review to false) and then changed in the interview order to True.

comment: |
  add_review_to_menu will add a Review Answers option to the menu bar you can find by clicking on the upper right corner.  The initial block will be rerun every time there's a new screen, so originally this block will set it to false and the option will not be added.  (This block needs to be below the interview order so that this block defines add_review_to_menu first.  After "add_review_to_menu" is reached in the interview order, it will go to the next section "summary" before it reruns a screen, so this page will not have the Review Answers option.  The next page will be the first page where add_review_to_menu is set to True when the initial block is run.

terms:  
  unsecured debts:  |
    An unsecured debt is a debt for which the creditor does not have a security interest in collateral, and the creditor is therefore not entitled to take property from you to satisfy that debt without a judgment.
    
    Common types of unsecured debt are credit cards, medical bills, most personal loans, and student loans*. These debts help you do something (buy items, pay your doctor, get an education), but they are not backed by a specific asset.
  secured debts:  |
    A secured debt is a debt for which the creditor has a security interest in collateral, meaning the creditor has a right to take property to satisfy the debt.
